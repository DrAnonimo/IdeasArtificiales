**Note:** The original contents of this repository were written in Spanish. Over time, we have transitioned to English to reach a broader audience. As a result, some of the earlier materials remain in Spanish, while newer projects and documentation are now published in English.

## Contents

**[Anatomy of an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm](https://github.com/DrAnonimo/IdeasArtificiales/tree/main/Anatom%C3%ADaAlgoritmoIA)** (Spanish)
- **Conceptual guide:** Clear explanation of the key building blocks of an AI/ML algorithm (data, features, model, training, evaluation) with didactic notes.
- **Hands-on Python code:** Example implementations (scripts/notebooks) that walk through dataset loading, model training, and evaluation.
- **Visual demos:** Plots and practical experiments (e.g., learning curves, metrics, confusion matrices) to illustrate results and trade-offs.
 

**[Artificial neurons and perceptrons](https://github.com/DrAnonimo/IdeasArtificiales/tree/neurona-artificial/NeuronasArtificialesPerceptron)** (Spanish)
- **Foundational overview:** Introduction to artificial neurons and the perceptron model, explaining their role as the basic computational unit in neural networks.
- **Python implementations:** Step-by-step code demonstrating how a perceptron learns to classify simple datasets through weight updates and activation functions.
- **Visualizations and experiments:** Graphical representations of decision boundaries, learning progress, and model performance across training iterations.

**[Neural networks](https://github.com/DrAnonimo/IdeasArtificiales/tree/AgenticAI/RedesNeuronales)** (Spanish)
- **Neural network implementation:** Practical example of a fully connected (dense) neural network designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Python and TensorFlow/Keras code:** Includes model definition, training, evaluation, and performance visualization.
- **Educational focus:** Demonstrates key deep learning concepts such as activation functions, optimization, and accuracy assessment through clear, reproducible experiments.

**[Agentic AI](https://github.com/DrAnonimo/IdeasArtificiales/tree/main/AgenticAI)**
- **LangGraph-based ‚ÄúLinkedIn News Agent‚Äù** prototype that searches AI news (via a web search API), summarizes candidates, adds a human-in-the-loop selection, and runs a fact-verification feedback loop before drafting a LinkedIn-ready post.
- **Modular agent workflow code + state/memory handling**, showing goal-directed execution, conditional routing, and regeneration on failed checks (iterative verification up to a cap).
- **Docs/assets for running a CLI demo** (figures/workflow description and usage notes) to reproduce the end-to-end process from retrieval ‚Üí summary ‚Üí selection ‚Üí verified post.

More content and analyses will be added over time. Feel free to explore and contribute!!
