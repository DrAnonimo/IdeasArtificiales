# AI News Identification Concepts Review

## Current Implementation Overview

### 1. Search Strategy

**Search Engine**: Tavily API with "advanced" search depth
**Search Queries** (9 predefined queries):
- "AI business impact 2024"
- "AI productivity tools"

### 2. Article Selection Criteria

**Primary Filter**: Relevance score from Tavily
**Deduplication**: URL-based (removes duplicates, keeps best score)
**Quantity**: Top 10 most relevant articles
**Content Fields Captured**:
- Title
- URL
- Content (full text)
- Relevance score

### 3. AI Bubble Analysis Framework

**5 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:

**Bubble Risk Calculation**: Weighted average of all indicators
**Market Impact Assessment**: Based on bubble indicators and sentiment

### 5. Current Limitations & Areas for Improvement

#### Search Scope Issues:
- **Limited Query Diversity**: Only 9 predefined queries
- **Static Queries**: No dynamic query generation based on trending topics
- **Broad Focus**: Queries are very general, may miss specific AI developments
- **No Time Filtering**: No recency bias in search results

#### Selection Criteria Issues:
- **Score-Only Ranking**: Relies solely on Tavily's relevance score
- **No Content Quality Filter**: No check for article quality or credibility
- **No Source Diversity**: May favor certain news sources
- **No Recency Weight**: Older articles may have higher scores

#### Analysis Framework Issues:
- **Keyword-Based Only**: No semantic understanding of bubble indicators
- **Static Thresholds**: Fixed thresholds may not adapt to market conditions
- **Limited Context**: No consideration of broader market context
- **No Trend Analysis**: No comparison with historical patterns

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Enhanced Search Strategy
- **Dynamic Query Generation**: Use LLM to generate queries based on current AI trends
- **Multi-Source Search**: Include additional news sources beyond Tavily
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Prioritize recent articles (last 24-48 hours)
- **Category-Specific Queries**: Separate queries for different AI domains (ML, NLP, Computer Vision, etc.)

### 2. Improved Selection Criteria
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combine relevance, recency, source credibility, and engagement
- **Source Diversity**: Ensure representation from different types of sources
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Filter out low-quality or clickbait articles
- **Trending Topics**: Weight articles about currently trending AI topics

### 3. Advanced Analysis Framework
- **Semantic Analysis**: Use embeddings to understand context beyond keywords
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust thresholds based on market conditions
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare against historical bubble patterns
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Cross-check findings with multiple sources

### 4. Additional Metrics
- **Media Attention**: Track frequency of AI mentions across media
- **Social Sentiment**: Include social media sentiment analysis
- **Expert Opinion**: Weight expert commentary more heavily
- **Market Indicators**: Include actual market data (stock prices, funding amounts)

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Search Scope**: Should we expand beyond the current 9 queries? What specific AI domains should we focus on?

2. **Selection Criteria**: Is relevance score alone sufficient, or should we add other factors?

3. **Analysis Depth**: Are the current 5 KPIs comprehensive enough, or should we add more indicators?

4. **Time Sensitivity**: How important is recency vs. relevance in article selection?

5. **Source Diversity**: Should we prioritize certain types of sources (academic, industry, mainstream media)?

6. **Bubble Definition**: Are our current bubble indicators aligned with your definition of an AI bubble?

7. **Market Context**: Should we consider broader economic indicators in our analysis?

8. **Validation**: How should we validate the accuracy of our bubble risk assessments?
