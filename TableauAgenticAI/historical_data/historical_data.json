The move underscores Meta\u2019s aggressive strategy to close the AI gap with OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic by acquiring top talent rather than just technology. Tulloch\u2019s transition comes after Meta unsuccessfully attempted to acquire his company outright, following similar offers to other engineers. Industry [...] Summary: Reveal HealthTech, an AI-powered healthcare startup based in Bengaluru and the U.S., raised $7.2 million in a Series A round led by Leo Capital, with continued support from Sanos Capital, W Health Ventures, and 2070 Health. The funding will bolster its core products, BioCanvas, which accelerates clinical trial recruitment using multimodal AI, and Prism AI, which automates healthcare workflows and improves patient adherence. Co-founded by Sanchit Mullick and Dr. Salim Ashar, the company [...] Summary: Researchers have unveiled a new procedural memory architecture for AI agents that enables them to incrementally learn, store, and reuse operational steps, thereby enhancing long-term performance and reducing costly retraining. This framework enables agents to build cumulative expertise and handle complex, multi-phase tasks more robustly. It holds promise for deploying more adaptive and cost-efficient AI agents in enterprise workflows.\n\nSource:Computerworld",

South Korea proposes easing of regulations on AI developers\n\nOn 15 September 2025, the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) announced plans to ease regulatory barriers for AI development this year by revising current legislation and issuing new guidelines for copyrighted content (the Initiative). The Initiative reflects the government\u2019s resolve to accelerate AI innovation and remove regulatory obstacles.\n\nNotably, the key measures include: [...] Criminal and Civil Liability: The Law introduces new criminal offences, increases penalties for certain offences, and establishes aggravating circumstances for crimes involving the use of AI systems, such as the unlawful dissemination of AI-generated or altered content. \n   Research: The Law promotes collaborative research between companies, research organisations, and technology transfer centres and facilitates access to high-quality data for AI development. [...] On 26 September 2025, the law on \u201cProvisions and Delegation to the Government on Artificial Intelligence\u201d, Law n. 132 of Sept. 23, 2025 (the Law) was published in the Italian Official Gazette. The Law aims to implement the provisions of the AI Act without creating new obligations beyond its scope, but nevertheless amounts to new rules.",

Researchers can expect new grant opportunities focused on fundamental challenges like interpretability, controllability, adversarial robustness, and energy-efficient AI. The emphasis on AI for scientific acceleration (e.g., fusion energy, biotech) presents new cross-disciplinary career paths for data scientists who can bridge the gap between LLMs and complex scientific modeling. [...] This highlights the rapid commoditization and consumerization of generative video models. The technical focus is shifting to speed, remixability, and control, demanding highly efficient text-to-video and video-to-video diffusion models that run with near-zero latency. AI engineers will need to focus on models that allow for seamless compositional editing and style transfer to support Meta\u2019s \u2018remix culture,\u2019 moving beyond simple clip generation to complex, controllable creative tools. [...] This move is a strong signal that the future of LLMs is agentic and anticipatory.

The system operates through \u201cself\u2011evolutionary reasoning,\u201d generating and mutating mathematical constructs until achieving verified proofs. It solved two long\u2011standing problems in complexity theory, using an LLM to maintain internal [...] Though narrower than OpenAI\u2019s or AMD\u2019s commercial achievements, DeepMind\u2019s innovation might be the most profound. It redefines the methodological core of knowledge creation, setting the stage for \u201czero\u2011person science,\u201d where discovery becomes a property of machine reasoning itself. October 2025 thus may be remembered not just for AI\u2019s economic triumphs, but for its intellectual leap into the creative process of science itself.\n\n  \n\nReferences (APA Style)",
