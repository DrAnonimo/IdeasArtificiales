The move underscores Meta\u2019s aggressive strategy to close the AI gap with OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic by acquiring top talent rather than just technology. Tulloch\u2019s transition comes after Meta unsuccessfully attempted to acquire his company outright, following similar offers to other engineers. Industry [...] Summary: Reveal HealthTech, an AI-powered healthcare startup based in Bengaluru and the U.S., raised $7.2 million in a Series A round led by Leo Capital, with continued support from Sanos Capital, W Health Ventures, and 2070 Health. The funding will bolster its core products, BioCanvas, which accelerates clinical trial recruitment using multimodal AI, and Prism AI, which automates healthcare workflows and improves patient adherence. Co-founded by Sanchit Mullick and Dr. Salim Ashar, the company [...] Summary: Researchers have unveiled a new procedural memory architecture for AI agents that enables them to incrementally learn, store, and reuse operational steps, thereby enhancing long-term performance and reducing costly retraining. This framework enables agents to build cumulative expertise and handle complex, multi-phase tasks more robustly. It holds promise for deploying more adaptive and cost-efficient AI agents in enterprise workflows.\n\nSource:Computerworld",

South Korea proposes easing of regulations on AI developers\n\nOn 15 September 2025, the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) announced plans to ease regulatory barriers for AI development this year by revising current legislation and issuing new guidelines for copyrighted content (the Initiative). The Initiative reflects the government\u2019s resolve to accelerate AI innovation and remove regulatory obstacles.\n\nNotably, the key measures include: [...] Criminal and Civil Liability: The Law introduces new criminal offences, increases penalties for certain offences, and establishes aggravating circumstances for crimes involving the use of AI systems, such as the unlawful dissemination of AI-generated or altered content. \n   Research: The Law promotes collaborative research between companies, research organisations, and technology transfer centres and facilitates access to high-quality data for AI development. [...] On 26 September 2025, the law on \u201cProvisions and Delegation to the Government on Artificial Intelligence\u201d, Law n. 132 of Sept. 23, 2025 (the Law) was published in the Italian Official Gazette. The Law aims to implement the provisions of the AI Act without creating new obligations beyond its scope, but nevertheless amounts to new rules.",
